# üìà Stock Price Prediction using ARIMA & SARIMA

## üîé Overview
This project demonstrates how to forecast stock prices using **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and **SARIMA** (Seasonal ARIMA) models.  
The notebook walks through **data preparation, stationarity testing, decomposition, model fitting, and forecasting** ‚Äî with explanations for why each step matters.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why ARIMA and SARIMA?
- **ARIMA** is effective for time series that exhibit **trend** but no clear seasonal pattern.  
- **SARIMA** extends ARIMA by adding a **seasonal component**, making it suitable for series with **recurring cycles** (e.g., yearly, monthly, or weekly patterns).  
- Stock data often contains both **trend** (long-term growth/decline) and **seasonality** (recurring cycles), so comparing ARIMA vs. SARIMA helps evaluate which captures the dynamics better.

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

### 1. **Load the Data**
We start by importing stock price data (daily closing prices).  
- The **‚ÄòClose‚Äô price** is usually the main target because it reflects the final value of the trading day.

---

### 2. **Test for Stationarity**
ARIMA/SARIMA models assume the series is **stationary**.  
- **Stationary series:** mean, variance, and autocorrelation stay constant over time.  
- Tests used:
  - **ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller):**  
    - Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): series is not stationary.  
    - Reject H‚ÇÄ if *p-value < 0.05*.
    - ADF Test: checks if unit root exists.


  - **KPSS Test:**  
    - Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): series is stationary.  
    - Reject H‚ÇÄ if *p-value < 0.05*.
    - KPSS Test: confirms if series is stationary.
- If not stationary, apply **differencing** or **log transformations**.









If p-value > 0.05 ‚Üí series is not stationary ‚Üí apply differencing/log transform.

### 3. **Time Series Decomposition**

- Break the series into:

- Trend ‚Üí long-term growth/decline

- Seasonality ‚Üí repeating cycles (e.g., yearly)

- Residuals ‚Üí noise


- Additive Model: constant seasonal effect.

- Multiplicative Model: seasonal effect grows with trend.

### 4. **Build Models**
- ARIMA

- SARIMA

### 5. **Forecast & Evaluate**

- Generate forecasts

- Compare predicted vs actual

- Evaluate with RMSE/MAE

### **Key Learnings**

- Stationarity testing ensures ARIMA assumptions are met.

- Decomposition helps decide between additive vs multiplicative models.

- ARIMA works well for non-seasonal series.

- SARIMA captures recurring patterns (like yearly effects).

While stock markets are noisy, these models help uncover underlying structure.
